/**
 * useServersHydrated — once-per-app mount hook that loads servers
 * from SQLite into the in-memory Zustand store.
 *
 * Mount this exactly once near the top of the React tree (in the
 * root layout, after the providers). It returns `{ hydrated }` so
 * callers can show a splash screen until hydration finishes.
 *
 * Why a hook and not a top-level side effect?
 *   - Side effects in module init run before React mounts, which means
 *     the database call would fire even on tests/SSR.
 *   - A hook inside the provider tree ensures it only runs in the
 *     app, and only once (the empty dep list).
